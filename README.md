# FlyVR 

**FlyVR** is a VR-based UAS operations platform designed to make drone piloting more accessible to non-professional users. By simulating real-world flight dynamics in a virtual environment, FlyVR provides an immersive training experience that enhances user proficiency without the need for costly equipment or formal training.


## Features
- **Virtual Flight Testing Cage** – A replica of SLU’s flight testing cage built in Unreal Engine 5 for realistic simulation.
  ![Cage VRE Sample](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fed0da7d-bb9c-4fb9-8f20-cce9aacc8bff)
- **Simulated Flight Dynamics** – In development: Incorporates flight physics and control logic to create an accurate UAV piloting experience.
- **Drone Operations Interface** – In development: Integrating a flight control system to mirror real-world UAS behavior.
- **Future Integration with Live Hardware** – Bridging virtual training with physical drone operations for real-time control.

## Tech Stack
- **Unreal Engine 5** – Environment design and simulation.
- **Blueprints & C++** – Game logic and physics implementation.
- **VR Integration** – In progress: testing on Meta Quest 3, with deployment planned for PC, VR headsets (OpenXR-supported devices), and additional platforms as applicable.

## Installation & Setup
To set up and explore FlyVR’s Virtual Flight Testing Cage in Unreal Engine 5:

### Requirements
- Git LFS installed ([Git LFS Installation Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage))
- Unreal Engine 5.4 installed ([Unreal Engine 5 Download](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/download))
### Setup Steps
1. Clone the Repository (Make sure Git LFS is installed)
   
   `git clone https://github.com/aidabah/FlyVR.git`

3. Open the Project in Unreal Engine 5
    - Launch Unreal Engine 5
    - Open the .uproject file inside the cloned repository
    
You can now explore and modify the FlyVR virtual environment in Unreal Engine 5.
